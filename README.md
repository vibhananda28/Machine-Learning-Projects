# [CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS ON TWEETS BY HEALTH CHANNELS](https://github.com/vibhananda28/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/clustering_tweets_health_channels.ipynb) : 
A text mining approach to clustering tweets by several health channels, using text preprocessing techniques, TF-IDF and K-Means and Agglomerative clustering. 

# [MBTI DATING PERSONALITY TYPE ANALYSIS WITH TEXT MINING TECHNIQUES- A DEEP DIVE](https://github.com/vibhananda28/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/IMDB_dating_posts_analysis.ipynb) : 
A deep dive into dating texts with labels on MBTI personality types, mainly answering the below questions:
1. Are there common word usage or patterns among all personality types?
2. Can we predict the MBTI type based on their conversation style?
3. Are there common dating traits among MBTI types based on their discussions and word choices?

# [Classification of urban land cover](https://github.com/vibhananda28/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Classification_Urban_Land.ipynb)
A classification task of urban land cover using high resolution aerial imagery, intended to assist sustainable urban planning efforts. Features consist of information on Multi-scale spectral, size, shape, and texture information etc. The task involves in depth data exploration, feature selection using ANOVA and Random forest feature importances, and finally used the random forest classifier with stratified k fold. The performance was tested using balanced accuracy score and cohen's kappa score.
