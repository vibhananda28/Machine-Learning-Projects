# [MBTI DATING PERSONALITY TYPE ANALYSIS WITH TEXT MINING TECHNIQUES- A DEEP DIVE](https://github.com/vibhananda28/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/IMDB_dating_posts_analysis.ipynb) : 
A deep dive into dating texts with labels on MBTI personality types, mainly answering the below questions:
1. Are there common word usage or patterns among all personality types?
2. Can we predict the MBTI type based on their conversation style?
3. Are there common dating traits among MBTI types based on their discussions and word choices?
